        <center><p><strong>Mario</strong> is the main character of the franchise.</p></center>
        <center><p>He's always bright and cheerful, and is most notable for his outfit: blue overalls, red shirt and cap, and of course, his moustache.</p></center>

         <center><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p></center>

         <center><p>Mario has a wide range of power-ups and boosts, such as the ability to throw fire from his hands, swivel into the air with a helicopter cap, slide on the floor on his belly as a penguin, swim like a frog, and many more.</p></center>

        <center><p>In contrast to Mario, Luigi is the shy and timid one of the brothers, afraid of everything, especially ghosts.</p></center>

        <center><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p></center>

        <center><p>Unlike Mario, Luigi is taller and can jump higher. However in some of the games, especially <strong>Super Mario Bros 2</strong> in Japan or <strong>Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels</strong>, he is slippery to play with, as he is more sensitive in walking, giving a more difficult challenge.</p></center>
        <center><p>As with his brother, he shares the same power-ups and boosts.</p></center>

        <center><p>The princess who always gets captured and is usually the damsel in distress, Peach is the kind and caring ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom who cares for her citizens, the <strong>Toads</strong>.</p></center>

     <center><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p></center>
     <center><p>Peach is only playable in a few games, as she usually gets kidnapped, allowing the plot in the games to happen, but that doesn't mean she has no power-ups in her artillery.</p></center>
     <center><p>She can turn into a cat, a tanooki, and use her umbrella to float safely to the ground. In <strong>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</strong>, a more enhanced version of Peach can be played, by getting the crown power-up as <strong>Toadette</strong>.</p></center>

         <center><p>Bowser is one the most powerful enemies in the franchise, making him a very dangerous threat. In his selection, he can spit fireballs and even breathe fire!</p></center>
         <center><p>Wanna make things worse? Usually after defeating Bowser in the newer games, he returns from the lava as a skeleton form. But what puts every ability to shame is when... he turns into a <strong>HUGE</strong> version of himself!</p></center>

     <center><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p></center>
     <center><p>Yoshi is unique when it comes to jumping. He can flutter jump which allows him to stay in the air for a bit longer period upon jumping. With different colors, it allows Yoshi to pull off different abilities. <strong>Red</strong> makes Yoshi spit out fireballs. <strong>Yellow</strong> makes him cause a stomp, and many more.

    	 <center><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p></center>
    	 <center><p>While not as dangerous as the King of Koopas, DK has a supposedly <strong>unlimited amount of barrels</strong> in his disposal, to throw mainly at <strong>Mario</strong>. He is strong too, but again, not as strong as Bowser they're on two different levels.</p></center>
